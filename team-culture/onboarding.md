# Onboarding at Solution8

Welcome to Solution8! 🎉 We're excited to have you on the team. This guide will help you navigate your first days, weeks, and months with us.

## 🎯 Onboarding Philosophy

Great onboarding sets you up for long-term success. Our approach:

**Goals:**
- Get you productive quickly (but not rushed)
- Build meaningful connections with teammates
- Understand our culture, values, and ways of working
- Provide clarity on expectations and growth path
- Set you up with tools, access, and knowledge

**Principles:**
- **Gradual ramp-up**: Start slow, build momentum
- **Active learning**: Hands-on experience over passive observation
- **Supported autonomy**: Guidance available, but you drive
- **Feedback loops**: Frequent check-ins and course-correction
- **Long-term view**: Onboarding continues beyond week one

## 🤔 Common Questions

### "I feel overwhelmed. Is this normal?"
Yes! There's a lot to learn. Remember:
- You're not expected to know everything quickly
- Feeling lost is part of the process
- Ask for help—that's what your buddy and team are for
- It gets easier week by week

### "I haven't shipped anything significant yet."
That's OK in the first few weeks. We'd rather you:
- Understand the landscape
- Build relationships
- Learn our patterns
- Ship quality over quantity

Speed comes with familiarity.

### "I'm stuck and don't know who to ask."
Default to asking your buddy first. They'll either help directly or point you to the right person. Also:
- Team Slack channel
- Your manager
- #help-[topic] channels
- The person who last touched the code (git blame)

There are no dumb questions.

### "How do I know if I'm doing well?"
Your manager will tell you directly. We don't believe in surprises. You'll have:
- Weekly 1-on-1s with feedback
- 30-day informal check-in
- 90-day formal review

If you're concerned, ask! Your manager wants you to succeed.

### "Can I suggest changes or improvements?"
Absolutely! Fresh eyes see things we've become blind to. We welcome your input on:
- Code and architecture
- Processes and workflows
- Documentation gaps
- Tooling improvements

There's value in the "new person perspective"—share it while you have it.
