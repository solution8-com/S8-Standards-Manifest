# How We Work

This guide outlines Solution8's approach to work, including our methodologies, policies, and practices that enable us to deliver exceptional results while maintaining balance and sustainability.

## 🎯 Work Methodology

### Agile with Pragmatism
We embrace agile principles but adapt them to what works for our teams and customers.

**Core Practices:**
- **2-week sprints** with clear goals and deliverables
- **Daily standups** (15 minutes max, async-friendly)
- **Sprint planning** to align on priorities
- **Retrospectives** to continuously improve
- **Demo days** to showcase work and gather feedback

**Our Adaptation:**
- We don't follow any framework religiously (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Teams choose ceremonies and cadences that work for them
- We prioritize outcomes over adherence to process
- Processes evolve based on team feedback

### Continuous Delivery
We ship early and often to get feedback and deliver value incrementally.

**Key Principles:**
- Feature flags enable continuous deployment with controlled rollouts
- Automated CI/CD pipelines ensure quality and speed
- Small, frequent releases reduce risk
- Monitoring and observability enable confident deployments

### Ownership Model
Teams own their domain end-to-end:
- **Build it, run it**: Teams are responsible for production support
- **You own the outcome**: Not just shipping features, but achieving results
- **Autonomy with accountability**: Make decisions, measure impact

## 🏡 Remote & Hybrid Work Policies

### Flexibility First
We trust team members to work when and where they're most effective.

**Location:**
- **Fully remote**: Most team members work remotely
- **Office optional**: Offices available in select locations for those who prefer
- **Distributed-first**: All processes designed for remote collaboration

**Hours:**
- **Flexible schedules**: No mandatory core hours (unless team-agreed)
- **Results-oriented**: Judged on output, not hours logged
- **Time zone aware**: Respect team members' local hours
- **Async-friendly**: Most communication works asynchronously

### Making Remote Work

**Required Practices:**
- **Overlap hours**: Teams agree on minimal overlap for real-time collaboration
- **Visible calendars**: Keep calendar up-to-date for scheduling
- **Camera on option**: Video encouraged but never mandatory
- **Dedicated workspace**: Ensure you can focus and participate effectively

**Team Norms:**
- Each team establishes their preferred working patterns
- Regular in-person or virtual team events for bonding
- Document decisions and context for async visibility

## ⚖️ Work-Life Balance

We believe sustainable performance requires balance and boundaries.

### Expectations
- **40 hours is the target**, not the minimum
- **Crunch time is rare** and acknowledged as exceptional
- **Vacation is mandatory**: Use your time off
- **Disconnect**: No expectation to respond outside work hours

### Protecting Balance

**What We Do:**
- **No-meeting blocks**: Protect focus time (e.g., "Focus Fridays")
- **Meeting caps**: Max 50% of week in meetings
- **Timezone respect**: Don't schedule meetings outside reasonable hours
- **Vacation coverage**: Plans ensure work continues without you

**What We Don't Do:**
- Send late-night Slack messages expecting immediate response
- Glorify overwork or "hustle culture"
- Penalize people for using benefits or taking time off
- Create artificial urgency

### Signs of Imbalance
Watch for and address:
- Regularly working late or weekends
- Skipping lunch or breaks
- Not taking vacation
- Feeling constantly "on"

**If you see these patterns** in yourself or teammates, speak up. Talk to your manager or People Ops.

## 📅 Meeting Culture

Meetings are expensive. We make them count.

### Meeting Principles

**Before Scheduling:**
- **Is this meeting necessary?** Could it be an email, doc, or async discussion?
- **Who needs to be there?** Invite only essential participants
- **What's the goal?** Clear objective and desired outcome
- **How long?** Default to 25 or 50 minutes (never 30 or 60)

**For Every Meeting:**
- **Agenda shared in advance** (at least 24 hours for important meetings)
- **Start and end on time** (respect everyone's calendar)
- **One topic at a time** (use parking lot for tangents)
- **Clear outcomes** (decisions made, action items assigned)
- **Notes published** (within 24 hours, in shared location)

### Meeting Types

**Standup (Daily, 15 min)**
- What did I accomplish yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Any blockers or help needed?
- *Tip: Keep it snappy; take details offline*

**Sprint Planning (Every 2 weeks, 2 hours)**
- Review sprint goals and priorities
- Break down user stories
- Estimate and commit to work
- *Tip: Pre-refine stories to save time*

**Retrospective (Every 2 weeks, 1 hour)**
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What will we change?
- *Tip: Rotate facilitators and formats*

**1-on-1s (Weekly or biweekly, 30 min)**
- Career development and growth
- Feedback and coaching
- Remove blockers
- *Tip: Employee drives the agenda*

### Meeting-Free Time
- **Focus Fridays**: No meetings after 12pm on Fridays
- **No-meeting days**: Teams can designate days without internal meetings
- **Protected mornings**: Default to afternoon meetings when possible

## 🧭 Decision-Making Processes

We push decisions to those closest to the work, with appropriate guardrails.

### Decision Levels

**Level 1: Individual Decisions**
- Day-to-day technical choices
- Personal work prioritization
- Implementation details
- *No approval needed; inform team as appropriate*

**Level 2: Team Decisions**
- Sprint commitments
- Technical architecture within domain
- Team processes and norms
- *Team consensus or lead decision*

**Level 3: Cross-Team Decisions**
- Changes affecting multiple teams
- Shared infrastructure or standards
- Significant resource allocation
- *Requires coordination and alignment*

**Level 4: Leadership Decisions**
- Company strategy and direction
- Major investments or changes
- Organizational structure
- *Executive team with stakeholder input*

### Decision-Making Frameworks

**Consensus**
- Everyone must agree
- Use for: Team norms, major changes affecting everyone
- Risk: Slow; can result in lowest-common-denominator

**Consent**
- No one objects strongly
- Use for: Technical decisions, process changes
- Benefit: Faster than consensus, still inclusive

**Consultative**
- Gather input, one person decides
- Use for: Time-sensitive decisions, clear ownership areas
- Benefit: Fast, accountable, informed

**DACI**
- Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed
- Use for: Complex cross-functional initiatives
- Benefit: Clear roles and accountability

### Making Good Decisions

**Before Deciding:**
1. Frame the decision clearly
2. Gather relevant data and perspectives
3. Consider alternatives
4. Understand implications
5. Document reasoning

**After Deciding:**
1. Communicate decision and rationale
2. Document for future reference
3. Define success metrics
4. Review and learn

**Disagreement & Commit**
Once a decision is made, we commit fully—even if we disagreed. This requires:
- Voicing concerns before the decision
- Assuming good intent
- Supporting the direction chosen
- Revisiting if new information emerges

## 📚 Knowledge Sharing Practices

Information is only valuable if it's accessible.

### Documentation Culture

**We Document:**
- Architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Onboarding and how-to guides
- Processes and runbooks
- Meeting notes and decisions
- Project context and history

**Documentation Principles:**
- **Write for future you**: Assume you'll forget
- **Make it findable**: Consistent structure, good search
- **Keep it current**: Review and update regularly
- **Show, don't just tell**: Examples and screenshots
- **Link liberally**: Connect related information

### Knowledge Sharing Channels

**Lunch & Learns** (Weekly, optional)
- Team members present on topics they're passionate about
- 30-45 minutes with Q&A
- Recorded for async viewing

**Tech Talks** (Monthly)
- Deep dives into technical topics
- External speakers occasionally
- Open to all engineers

**Show & Tell** (Bi-weekly)
- Informal demos of work in progress
- Get feedback early
- Learn what others are working on

**Book Clubs** (Ongoing)
- Team members discuss technical books
- Company provides books
- Casual, self-organized

**Internal Blog**
- Share learnings, war stories, tips
- Searchable knowledge base
- Encouraged but not required

### Learning & Development

**Conference Budget**
- Annual budget for conferences, courses, books
- Encouraged to share learnings with team

**20% Time**
- Dedicate time to learning and exploration
- Can be used for courses, side projects, open source

**Mentorship**
- Formal mentorship program
- Pair programming and knowledge transfer
- Career coaching from senior team members

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

How we work should evolve as we learn.

### Feedback Loops
- Sprint retrospectives identify improvements
- Quarterly surveys assess team health
- Annual culture surveys inform big changes
- Regular 1-on-1s surface individual concerns

### Experimentation
- Teams can pilot new processes
- Share learnings across the organization
- Adopt what works, discard what doesn't
- No sacred cows—everything is questionable

### Metrics That Matter
We track indicators of healthy work:
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery
- Team satisfaction scores
- Work-life balance indicators

## 🎯 Remember

The best process is the one that enables great work without getting in the way. When processes feel bureaucratic or pointless, speak up—they probably need to change.
