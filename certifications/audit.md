# Audit Preparation and Management

## Overview

Audits are systematic examinations of an organization's processes, controls, and compliance with standards and regulations. Effective audit preparation ensures successful outcomes, identifies areas for improvement, and demonstrates commitment to compliance.

## Types of Audits

### Internal Audits

**Purpose**: Self-assessment and continuous improvement

**Characteristics**:
```
- Conducted by organization personnel
- Scheduled regularly (quarterly, annually)
- Focus on process improvement
- Findings for internal use
- Preparatory for external audits
```

**Benefits**:
```
- Early problem identification
- External audit preparation
- Process improvement
- Training opportunity
- Control validation
```

### External Audits

**Purpose**: Independent verification and certification

**Types**:

**1. Certification Audits**
```
Scope: ISO 27001, ISO 9001, etc.
Frequency: Initial + annual surveillance + 3-year recertification
Outcome: Certificate of compliance
Audience: Customers, market
```

**2. Compliance Audits**
```
Scope: SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.
Frequency: Annual or as required
Outcome: Audit report or attestation
Audience: Customers, regulators, partners
```

**3. Regulatory Audits**
```
